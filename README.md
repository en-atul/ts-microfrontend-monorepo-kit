## 🎯 Overview

This monorepo provides a complete foundation for building scalable microfrontend applications. It
solves several key challenges in modern web development:

- 🏢 **Microfrontend Architecture**: Implement independent, deployable frontend applications that
  work together seamlessly
- 🔄 **Code Sharing**: Share components and logic between applications efficiently using Webpack 5
  Module Federation
- 📝 **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support across all applications and packages
- ⚡️ **Development Workflow**: Streamlined development experience with hot reloading and custom CLI
  tools
- 🛡️ **Security**: Built-in protection for remote module access
- 📈 **Scalability**: Monorepo structure that scales with your team and application needs

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- pnpm >= 9.0.0

### ⚡️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ts-microfrontend-monorepo-kit.git

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development
pnpm dev
```

### 🔧 Development Commands

- `pnpm start:host`: Start host application
- `pnpm start:remote`: Start remote application
- `pnpm build`: Build all applications
- `pnpm lint`: Run linting
- `pnpm format`: Format code

## 🛠 Development Tools

### 🤖 Dev CLI (@repo/dev-cli)

Custom CLI tool that provides:

- 🔄 Workflow automation
- 🖥️ Development server management
- ⚡️ Build process optimization
- 🏗 Project scaffolding

Usage:

```bash
# Create a new component
dev-cli generate component

# Run development servers
dev-cli serve
```

### ⚙️ Shared Configurations

- 📝 TypeScript configurations
- 🧹 ESLint rules
- 🔧 Webpack configurations
- 🛠 Babel presets
- 🧪 Jest setup

## 🏗 Architecture

### 🏢 Microfrontend Implementation

1. **Host Application**: Main application shell

   - 🧭 Manages routing
   - 🔐 Handles authentication
   - 🎮 Orchestrates remote modules

2. **Remote Applications**: Independent features
   - 📦 Expose components via Module Federation
   - 🚀 Can be deployed independently
   - 💾 Maintain their own state and routing

### 🔄 Module Federation

- 📥 Dynamic loading of remote modules
- 🔄 Shared dependencies management
- ⚡️ Runtime integration of components
- 📈 Version control of shared modules

## 🔒 Security

### 🛡️ Remote Module Protection

- ✅ Origin validation middleware
- 🔐 Configurable access controls
- 🌐 CORS protection
- ⚡️ Rate limiting support

### 📋 Best Practices

- 🔐 Secure module loading
- 🛡️ Protected development endpoints
- ⚙️ Environment-based configurations
- 🔄 Error boundary implementation

## 📦 Deployment

### 🚀 Build Process

```bash
# Production build
pnpm build

# Environment-specific builds
NODE_ENV=staging pnpm build
```

### 📤 Output

- 📦 Optimized bundles
- 🗺️ Source maps
- 🎨 Asset optimization
- ⚡️ Cache management
